# Markdown Editor with Tabs

This is a simple Markdown editor application that allows you to switch between viewing the rendered HTML and the source Markdown. It uses the `marked` library for Markdown conversion and `highlight.js` for code block syntax highlighting.

## Features

-   **Tabbed Interface:** Switch between 'Rendered HTML' and 'Markdown Source' views.
-   **Live Preview:** The HTML view updates as you type in the Markdown source.
-   **Syntax Highlighting:** Code blocks in the rendered output are syntax highlighted.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Development Notes

-   The application is a single HTML file (`index.html`) for simplicity and easy deployment via GitHub Pages.
-   External libraries for Markdown parsing (`marked`) and syntax highlighting (`highlight.js`) are included via CDN.
